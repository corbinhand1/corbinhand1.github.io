Hey Ally! ðŸ‘‹

I stumbled across this absolutely hilarious website and immediately thought of you! 

It's called "Bar Tricks Academy" and it's basically a fake company that teaches people magic tricks for bars. The whole thing is ridiculous and I know you'd get a kick out of it! ðŸ˜„

ðŸŽª It's got fake courses like "Coin Disappearing Act" and "Beer Bottle Balancing" with the most ridiculous descriptions and testimonials you've ever seen!

The best part? It mentions Evansville bars specifically and has all these fake reviews from people recommending the classes. It's clearly meant to be a joke, but it's actually pretty well-made and entertaining!

Trust me, you'll love it! It's the perfect mix of absurd and well-designed. Let me know what you think! ðŸŽ­

P.S. - Click around and try the buttons - they have some fun interactive effects too! âœ¨

Hope this brings a smile to your face! ðŸ˜Š
P.S. - This is totally unrelated to my actual work, just found it randomly!
